Macbacklight
========

Macbacklight is very simple application that changes MacBooks' screen
backlight level.

It is based on Hugo Barrera's kbdlight utility.

While usable standalone, the main goal is for it to be used by other
applications, including things like sxhkd or xbindkeys.

Usage
-----
Usage is ridiculously simple:

    macbacklight [up|down|off|max]
